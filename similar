I struggled to find your profile, I remembered the picture, this comes from a comment or discussion, you send:
Spain: in English translated with qtranslate, sorry for mistakes. Hi, I wanted to tell you, if it's no trouble, both for you and for GitHub and SourceForge: when looking for someone personally and professionally, for their alli saved jobs, not comparable alike, as introduced in the search, do some tests and see results even review the composition of the content, bad influences: uppercase and lowercase letters, together or separate parts of the content, see that menus are not equal in github and SourceForge (recommend the use of lowercase), and / or matches in search engine (check at each site), cost locate people in their own name, almost dedicated to software or solutions or search or jump to almost not in my hand to be updated this matter , on his part, only verify that their activities are as close, hopefully equal, if possible in these 2 sites. I communicate for the first time here with you, I hope you recognize me, I start is communicated to Spain: and luckily I could send you my observations, for improving BCU Uninstaller, apologizing again if they were excessive, constructive criticism and extensive content, and that no voice to dictate text, little thanks
